I thought that the last lecture was quite interesting, some of the jokes were a little much but I liked his optimism and the way he handled the deck he was handed. It made me think about how I would react if I only had months to live and how I would spend them. But I also liked how he brought up his failures, especially of those he hadn’t revealed before such as not getting to prestigious schools but how he still persevered. It made me think how I should be more adaptable to my situations no matter how dire they may seem and play the hand I’m dealt to the best of my ability.
